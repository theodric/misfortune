My Nose Is Growing Old
----------------

Yup.
A long lazy September look
in the mirror
says it's true:

I'm 31
and my nose is growing
	old.

It starts about 1/2
	an inch
below the bridge
and strolls geriatrically
	down
for another inch or so:
	stopping.

fortunately, the rest
of the nose is comparatively
	young.

I wonder if girls
will want me with an
	old nose.

I can hear them now
the heartless bitches!

"He's cute
		but his nose
is old."
