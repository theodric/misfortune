Your Catfish Friend

If I were to live my life
in catfish forms
in scaffolds of skin and whiskers
at the bottom of a pond
and you were to come by
	one evening
when the moon was shining
own into my dark home
and stand there at the edge
	of my affection
and think, "It's beautiful
here by this pond. I wish
somebody loved me,"
I'd love you and be your catfish
friend and drive such lonely
thoughts from your mind
and suddenly you would be
	at peace
and ask yourself, "I wonder
if there are any catfish
in this pond? It seems like
a perfect place for them."
