San Francisco

	This poem was found written on a paper bag
by Richard Brautigan in a laundromat in
San Francisco. The author is unknown.

By accident, you put 
Your money in my
Machine (#4)
By accident, I put
My money in another
Machine (#6)

On purpose, I put
Your clothes in the
Empty machine full
Of water and no
Clothes

It was lonely.
